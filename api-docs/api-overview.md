# API Overview

The ethscriptions.com API does not require a key, however it is rate limited. If you need more throughput, contact [Middlemarch](https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/) on Twitter. If you build something cool, _also_ contact [Middlemarch](https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/) on Twitter!

There is a goerli API and a mainnet API. The base URIs are:

* `https://goerli-api.ethscriptions.com/api`
* `https://api.ethscriptions.com/api`

Use the base URIs along with the paths in the endpoints sections to access the API.
